// Sibling to Internal.IKeyedItemSource for the ItemsRepeater dispatch arm
// in `Reconciler.BindErasedKeyedItemsSource`. The erased binder pulls
// keys + counts through IKeyedItemSource (the same shape ListViewBase
// uses); for ItemsRepeater hosts it ALSO needs a factory closure plus
// the StackLayout knobs the repeater requires before any container
// realizes. Those are not naturally part of an "item source," so they
// live on this companion interface.
//
// Implementation contract: the source object handed to the binder
// (typically the element itself — see `LazyStackElementBase`) implements
// IKeyedItemSource AND this interface. The binder casts to find the
// factory-side methods. Internal because the abstract layout knobs +
// IElementFactory contract are not part of the public V1 PREVIEW surface
// (`ReactorListState` is internal). Promote to public if a descriptor
// author needs to host a new ItemsRepeater-backed control without
// inheriting `LazyStackElementBase`.
