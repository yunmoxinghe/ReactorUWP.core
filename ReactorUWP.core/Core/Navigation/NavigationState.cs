/// Reactor intentionally does not pick a serialization format for navigation state.
/// This record is a plain POCO with no serializer-specific attributes — callers can
/// persist it however they like: JSON via <c>System.Text.Json</c> (preferably with a
/// source-generated <c>JsonSerializerContext</c> for AOT-safety), MessagePack, or by
/// hand. Avoid insecure or obsolete serializers.
