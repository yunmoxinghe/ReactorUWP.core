// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  Spec 045 §2.4 — Reactor-native drag session.
//
//  Replaces upstream WinUI.Dock's static GUID→DockManager / GUID→Document
//  dictionaries (Helpers/DragDropHelpers.cs). Spec §8.9 calls those out as
//  a security/reliability anti-pattern (process-wide string-keyed payload
//  surface; cross-window string trust); the Reactor port uses object refs
//  via a single in-flight session.
//
//  Contract:
//   • At most one active session per process — matches upstream's
//     single-drag interaction model and spec §4.6 (drag-out restricted
//     to a single manager in P1, retained in P2 until cross-window
//     pipeline lands separately).
//   • UI-thread-affined: Begin / Confirm / Cancel run on the dispatcher
//     thread that owns the originating DockManager. Off-thread access is
//     undefined (matches DockHostModel contract per spec §8.10).
//   • No GC retention of completed sessions — End / Cancel null out
//     references so a closed pane / unmounted manager can be collected
//     immediately.
//
//  The session is purely a state holder. Layout mutation on confirm is
//  the host's responsibility (DockHostNativeComponent applies it via the
//  immutable-Layout-rebuild pattern).
